# JAVABank_Inheritance_Hierarchy
Description:

The Java Bank Inheritance Hierarchy project is an object-oriented programming demonstration that models a simplified banking system using Java classes and inheritance. This project includes four key classes: Account, Main, CheckingAccount, and SavingsAccount. Each class plays a specific role in creating a flexible and extensible representation of different types of bank accounts.

Key Features:

    Account Class: The Account class serves as the base class for all bank accounts. It encapsulates common attributes and methods, including account number, balance, deposit, and withdrawal.

    CheckingAccount Class: The CheckingAccount class extends the Account class, introducing features like overdraft limits and customized withdrawal logic to prevent overdrafts beyond the specified limit.

    SavingsAccount Class: Similarly, the SavingsAccount class extends the Account class. It includes an interest rate attribute and methods to apply interest to the account balance.

    Main Class: The Main class is the entry point of the project. It provides a place to create instances of different account types, demonstrate their functionalities, and showcase how they interact within the inheritance hierarchy.

Benefits:

    Hands-On OOP Learning: This project offers practical experience with object-oriented programming concepts, particularly inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

    Code Reusability: The base Account class promotes code reusability, making it easier to add new account types or features while maintaining a clean and organized codebase.

How to Use:

    Clone or download the project repository from GitHub.
    Compile and run the Main class using a Java development environment.
    Explore the code to understand how the Account, CheckingAccount, and SavingsAccount classes interact within the inheritance hierarchy.
    Run sample scenarios to observe the behavior of different account types.
